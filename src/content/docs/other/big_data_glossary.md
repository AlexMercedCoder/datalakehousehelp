Welcome to the Big Data Glossary, your guide to understanding key terms in the realm of data management, analytics, and technology. Whether you're a data professional or a curious learner, this glossary provides concise explanations of essential concepts within the big data ecosystem.

**MPP (Massively Parallel Processing):** A technique used to process large volumes of data by distributing tasks across multiple processors or nodes in a parallel computing environment.

**Hadoop:** An open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers, based on the MapReduce and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) concepts.

**Hive:** A data warehousing infrastructure built on top of Hadoop, allowing SQL-like querying and analysis of structured and semi-structured data.

**Partitioning:** The practice of dividing large datasets into smaller, more manageable segments based on specific attributes, enhancing data organization and query performance.

**Clustering:** The process of grouping similar data points together to discover patterns and relationships within the data.

**Data Lake:** A repository that stores vast amounts of raw data in its native format, offering flexibility for various data processing and analysis tasks.

**Data Warehouse:** A centralized repository that stores structured data from various sources, optimized for querying and reporting.

**Data Lakehouse:** An architecture that combines the best elements of data lakes and data warehouses, providing scalable storage, processing, and analysis capabilities.

**In-process Database:** A database system that resides in the same process as the application, offering fast and direct data access.

**Apache Foundation:** A nonprofit organization that supports and develops open-source software projects, including Apache Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka.

**Linux Foundation:** A nonprofit organization that promotes the growth of open-source software and collaboration, including projects related to the Linux operating system.

**Data Modeling:** The process of creating a conceptual, logical, and physical representation of data structures and relationships within a database.

**Kimball Methodology:** An approach to data warehousing and business intelligence that emphasizes dimensional modeling, designed for user-friendly querying and reporting.

**Inmon Methodology:** A data warehousing approach that focuses on building a centralized data repository, enabling integration of various data sources.

**Star Schema:** A data modeling technique where a central fact table is connected to dimension tables, facilitating efficient querying and analysis.

**Primary Key:** A unique identifier for a record in a database table, ensuring data integrity and supporting data retrieval.

**Foreign Key:** A reference in a database table that points to the primary key in another table, establishing relationships between tables.

**Observability:** The practice of monitoring, measuring, and understanding system behavior to gain insights into its performance and health.

**DataOps/Data-As-Code:** A methodology that applies DevOps principles to data management, treating data infrastructure and processes as code.

**Data Contracts:** Formal agreements that define the structure, format, and semantics of data exchanged between systems or teams.

**Metastore:** A centralized repository that stores metadata about data assets, enabling easier data discovery and management.

**Data Lakehouse Table Format:** A structured representation of data in data lakehouses, supporting efficient querying and analysis.

**Data Catalog:** A repository that indexes and organizes metadata about data assets, facilitating data discovery and governance.

**Semantic Layer:** An abstraction that provides a user-friendly representation of underlying data structures, enabling business users to query data without technical complexity.

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** A security model that assigns access permissions based on user roles, ensuring controlled and authorized data access.

**ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control):** A security model that determines access based on attributes and policies associated with data and users.

**SCD (Slowly Changing Dimensions):** A technique for handling changes to dimensional data over time, ensuring historical accuracy and analysis.

**Normalization:** A database design process that reduces data redundancy by organizing data into separate tables based on relationships.

**Denormalization:** A database design process that combines data from multiple tables to improve query performance and simplify analysis.

**Indexing:** The practice of creating data structures to optimize data retrieval, enhancing query performance in databases.

This glossary provides a starting point for understanding the terminology used in the big data landscape. As technology evolves, new terms and concepts emerge, shaping the way we manage, analyze, and derive insights from data.
